        "title": "1. Introduction\n",
        "text": "As shown by [RFC6036], many service providers are actively planning to deploy IPv6 to alleviate the imminent shortage of IPv4 addresses. This will affect all service providers who have implemented [RFC1149]. It is therefore necessary, indeed urgent, to specify a method of transmitting IPv6 datagrams [RFC2460] over the RFC 1149 medium, rather than obliging those service providers to migrate to a different medium. This document offers such a specification."
      },
      {
        "title": "3.4 Multicast\n",
        "text": "RFC 1149 does not specify a multicast address mapping. It has been reported that attempts to implement IPv4 multicast delivery have resulted in excessive noise in transmission elements, with subsequent drops of packet digests. At the present time, an IPv6 multicast mapping has not been specified, to avoid such problems.\n\n"
      },
      {
        "title": "4. Quality-of-Service Considerations\n",
        "text": "[RFC2549] is also applicable in the IPv6 case. However, the author of RFC 2549 did not take account of the availability of the Differentiated Services model [RFC2474]. IPv6 packets carrying a non-default Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value in their Traffic Class field [RFC2460] MUST be specially encoded using green or blue ink such that the DSCP is externally visible. Note that red ink MUST NOT be used to avoid confusion with the usage of red paint specified in RFC 2549.\n\nRFC 2549 did not consider the impact on quality of service of different types of carriers. There is a broad range. Some are very fast but can only carry small payloads and transit short distances, others are slower but carry large payloads and transit very large distances. It may be appropriate to select the individual carrier for a packet on the basis of its DSCP value. Indeed, different carriers will implement different per-hop behaviors according to RFC 2474."
      },
      {
        "title": "5. Routing and Tunneling Considerations\n",
        "text": "Routing carriers through the territory of similar carriers, without peering agreements, will sometimes cause abrupt route changes, looping packets, and out-of-order delivery. Similarly, routing carriers through the territory of predatory carriers may potentially cause severe packet loss. It is strongly recommended that these factors be considered in the routing algorithm used to create carrier routing tables. Implementers should consider policy-based routing to ensure reliable packet delivery by routing around areas where territorial and predatory carriers are prevalent.\n\nThere is evidence that some carriers have a propensity to eat other carriers and then carry the eaten payloads. Perhaps this provides a new way to tunnel an IPv4 packet in an IPv6 payload, or vice versa.\n\nHowever, the decapsulation mechanism is unclear at the time of this writing."
      },
      {
        "title": "6. Multihoming Considerations\n",
        "text": "Some types of carriers are notoriously good at homing. Surprisingly, this property is not mentioned in RFC 1149. Unfortunately, they prove to have no talent for multihoming, and in fact enter a routing loop whenever multihoming is attempted. This appears to be a fundamental restriction on the topologies in which both RFC 1149 and the present specification can be deployed."
      },
      {
        "title": "7. Internationalization Considerations\n",
        "text": "In some locations, such as New Zealand, a significant proportion of carriers are only able to execute short hops, and only at times when the background level of photon emission is extremely low. This will impact the availability and throughput of the solution in such locations."
      },
      {
        "title": "8. Security Considerations\n",
        "text": "The security considerations of [RFC1149] apply. In addition, recent experience suggests that the transmission elements are exposed to many different forms of denial-of-service attacks, especially when perching. Also, the absence of link layer identifiers referred to above, combined with the lack of checksums in the IPv6 header, basically means that any transmission element could be mistaken for any other, with no means of detecting the substitution at the network layer. The use of an upper-layer security mechanism of some kind seems like a really good idea.\n\nThere is a known risk of infection by the so-called H5N1 virus. Appropriate detection and quarantine measures MUST be available."
